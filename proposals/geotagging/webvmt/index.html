        This specification defines WebVMT, the Web Video Map Tracks format, which is an enabling technology whose main use is for marking up external map track resources in connection with the HTML &lt;track&gt; element. WebVMT files provide map presentation and annotation synchronised to video content, including animation support, and more generally any form of geolocation data that is time-aligned with audio or video content.
      </p>

      <section id='mountainrescue'>
        <h2>Coastguard/Mountain Rescue</h2>
        <p>
          A missing person is reported to the rescue services, who deploy a drone to search inaccessible areas of coastline or moorland for their target. The drone relays back a live video stream from its camera and geolocation data from its GPS receiver to a remote human operator who is piloting it.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the search continues, the operator spots a target on the video feed and can instantly call up an electronic map, synchronised to the video, which has been automatically following the drone’s position and plotting its ground track. The display gives the operator immediate context for the video, and allows them to override the automatic map control and zoom in to pinpoint the target’s precise location from the features visible in the video and on the map/satellite view. They mark the location and then zoom out to assess the surrounding terrain and advise the recovery team of the best approach to the target. For example, the terrain may dictate very different approach routes if either the person has twisted their ankle at the top of a cliff, or has fallen and is lying at the bottom of the same cliff, though the co-ordinates are almost identical in both cases.
        </p>
        <p>
          The operator has been able to make important decisions quickly, which may be life critical, and deploy recovery resources effectively.
        </p>
        <ul class='note' title='Benefits'>

      <section id='areasurvey'>
        <h2>Area Survey</h2>
        <p>
          A survey drone is equipped with a camera which records an image of the ground directly below it. The pilot is a remote human operator, tasked with surveying a defined area from particular height in order to capture the required data.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the survey progresses, geometric shapes are automatically added to the map to represent areas which have been included. Once the drone has finished its sweep, the operator can quickly confirm whether the required area has been completely covered. If any areas have been missed, the pilot can use the map to navigate and make additional passes to fill the gaps, before returning to base.
        </p>
        <p>
          Adding map track (VMT) files to the survey archive provides a geospatial index to the videos, allowing a particular geographic location to be found more rapidly by virtue of their small file size. Online video archives can be indexed more quickly using this web-friendly format.
        </p>
        <p>
          The operator has been easily able to verify the quality of their own work and correct any errors, saving time and additional effort in redeployment. Video footage has been indexed by geolocation rapidly and in a search-engine-friendly format.
        </p>
        <ul class='note' title='Benefits'>

        <h2>Outdoor Trails</h2>
        <p>
          An outdoor sportsperson, e.g. snowboarder or cyclist, is equipped with a helmet camera and/or mobile phone to record video footage and GPS data. They set off to find new challenges and practice their skills, e.g. off-piste or on mountain trails, and discover new routes and areas that they would like to explore in future, chatting to the camera as they go.
Afterwards, they upload the video to share their experience with the online community, so others can quickly identify locations of particularly interesting sections of the featured trail. Using the synchronised map view in their browser, community members can easily see where they need to go in order to try it for themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          The operator has been able to fully engage in their sporting activity, without making any written notes, while simultaneously recording the details needed to guide others to the same locations. Their changing location over time can also be used to calculate speed and distance information, which can be displayed alongside the footage.

        <h2>TV Sports Coverage</h2>
        <p>
          A TV production company is covering a sports event that takes place over a large area, e.g. rallying, road cycling or sailing, using a number of mobile video devices including competitor cams, e.g. dash cams or helmet cams, and drones to provide shots of inaccessible areas, e.g. remote terrain or over water.
        </p>
        <p>
          Feeds from all the cameras are streamed to the production control room, where their geolocation data are combined on a map showing the locations of every competitor and camera, each labelled for easy identification. The live map enables the director to quickly choose the best shot and anticipate where and when to deploy their drone cameras to catch competitors at critical locations on the course as the competition develops in real time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Multiple operators can function concurrently, both autonomously and under central direction. Mobile assets can be monitored and deployed from an operations centre to provide optimum coverage of the developing live event.

        <h2>Proxy Explorer</h2>
        <p>
          Important details of a remote area have been captured on video. It is not possible to revisit the location for safety reasons or because it has physically changed in the intervening time. Footage can be retrospectively geotagged against a concurrent map to allow the viewer to better interpret and identify features seen in the footage. Explanatory annotations can be added to the video-map track to help future viewers' understanding and aggregate the collective analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
          Multiple operators can contribute their observations to provide a group analysis, iteratively adding new details and discarding out-of-date information. Experts can offer insight about filmed locations, which would otherwise be inaccessible to them.

          A TV production company designs a new game show which involves competitors searching for targets across a wide area, with an operations centre remotely monitoring their progress and providing updates. Competitors are equipped with body-worn video or helmet cameras to relay footage of their view.
        </p>
        <p>
          Geolocation context allow central operators to better understand the participants' actions and to remotely direct them more efficiently. Competitors' positions can displayed to the TV audience on annotated 2D- or 3D-maps for clearer presentation.

        <h2>Swarm Monitoring</h2>
        <p>
          A swarm of drones is deployed to perform a task, and their operations are monitored centrally. Geolocation details of the swarm are automatically collated and broadcast to the drone pilots, showing the locations of all the drones and each is circled with a suitable safety zone to warn their operators in case two units find themselves flying in close proximity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pilots are safely able to operate either autonomously or under the direction of central control. Extra zonal information can be added to the operators' maps to show the outer perimeter of their operating area and warn of fixed aerial hazards, e.g. a radio mast, or transient hazards, e.g. a helicopter.

        <h2>Crisis Response</h2>
        <p>
          Disaster strikes, e.g. hurricane, tsunami, and emergency response teams are deployed to the affected area. However, it is difficult to verify which problems people are facing, what resources would help them and exactly where these events are occurring. Maps are unreliable as the infrastructure has been damaged, though people on the ground have the relevant knowledge if it could be reliably recorded and shared.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyone with a basic smartphone could video events with reliable geospatial data, as GPS receivers can operate without the need for a mobile phone signal by using satellite data, to accurately document the problems they face. Even if the cell network is not operational, this information can be physically delivered to crisis coordinators to notify them of the issues that need to be addressed, including an accurate location in a common format. Crisis events can be reliably recorded, knowledge can be shared and aggregated, and relief resources can be accurately targeted and deployed to the correct locations.

        <h2>Fastest Lap</h2>
        <p>
          An amateur racer attempts to set a fastest lap time in a vehicle equipped with a dashcam. The film can be reviewed with details of location and vehicle telemetry to analyse its performance, and that of the driver, to identify where improvements can be made. The ideal racing line can be determined and measured against the actual line taken, and optimum braking points can be established by suggesting and testing corrections.
        </p>
        <p>
          Driver's commentary can be used to identify performance issues along with vehicle audio response, e.g. engine tone and tyres, for comparison with telemetry data to rapidly iterate testing using community analysis tools. Results can be shared online in a common format to display metrics and to demonstrate veracity.

      <section id='policeevidence'>
        <h2>Police Evidence</h2>
        <p>
          A web-based police system is established to allow dashcam video evidence of driving offences to be submitted digitally by members of the public who have witnessed them. Detectives are able to identify the time and vehicles involved directly from the uploaded footage, and accurately determine the location at which the incident occurred from the digital metadata included.
        </p>
        <p>
          Its ability to accept open format data also makes the system available to cyclists and pedestrians who can record video with location on their helmet cameras and smartphones respectively, providing wider access to the service beyond the dashcam community. Metadata, e.g. location, from different video manufacturers is often recorded in mutually-incompatible formats, but video-map track support enables synchronised location (and other) data to be extracted from recordings using manufacturers' or community tools, without affecting source video integrity, and submitted to the police system in a common format, significantly reducing development costs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Officers have been able to identify incident locations quickly and accurately, without sacrificing evidence integrity. The online service has been made available to a wider audience of drivers, cyclists and pedestrians, without incurring additional development costs.
        </p>
        <ul class='note' title='Benefits'>
          <li>Accurate location with evidence integrity preserved;</li>

    <section class='informative' id='stateoftheart'>
      <h2>State of the Art</h2>
      <p>
        No standard format currently exists by which web browsers can synchronise geolocation data with video. Though many browser-supported formats exist to present the two data streams separately, e.g. MPEG for video and GPX for geolocation, there is no viable synchronisation mechanism for video playback time with geolocation information.
      </p>
      <section id='currentsolutions'>
        <h2>Current Solutions</h2>
        <p>
          Material Exchange Format (MXF) was developed by the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE) to synchronise metadata, including geolocation, with audio and video streams using a register of key-length-value (KLV) triples. The breadth of its scope has resulted in interoperability issues, as different vendors implement different parts of the standard, and has produced implementations from high-profile companies which are mutually incompatible. KLVs can also be embedded within MPEG files, though this does not address the synchronisation issue for other web video formats such as WebM.
        </p>
        <p>
          Video camera manufacturers have taken various approaches, resulting in a number of non-standard solutions including embedding geolocation data within the MPEG metadata stream in disparate formats, e.g. Go-Pro Metadata Format (GPMF), or recording a separate geolocation file in a proprietary format alongside the associated video file. From a hardware perspective, a few high-end cameras provide geotagging out of the box and all require an add-on device to support this feature.
        </p>
        <p>
          Geospatial data are not currently accessible in the video Document Object Model (DOM) in HTML nor via video playback APIs in smartphones, e.g. Android, though their host devices are typically equipped with both a video camera and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver capable of capturing the required information.
        </p>
        <p>
          In sharp contrast, still photos have a well-established geotagging standard called Exif, which was published by the Japan Electronic Industries Development Association (JEIDA) in 1995 and defines a metadata tag to embed geolocation data within TIFF and JPEG images. This is widely supported by manufacturers of photographic equipment and software worldwide, including low-end smartphones, making this feature cheap and accessible to the public.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id='growingrequirements'>
        <h2>Growing Requirements</h2>
        <p>
          Historically, there has been no requirement for a comparable video standard, but the urgency for such a standard is growing fast due to the emerging markets for 'mobile video devices,' e.g. drones, dashcams, body-worn video and helmet cameras, as well as the rise in high-quality video and geolocation support in the global smartphone market.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id='accessiblestandard'>
        <h2>Accessible Standard Opportunity</h2>
        <p>
          Using current W3C recommendations, it is possible for an able programmer to synchronise video-geolocation 'metadata' with a &lt;video&gt; element using a &lt;track&gt; child element. However, this is a non-trivial development task which requires an understanding of the video DOM events and Javascript file handling, making it inaccessible to the vast majority of web users. In addition, video map tracks are a clearly identified metadata subclass, which could be isolated in a similar way to video text tracks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Establishing a standard file format would allow interoperability and information sharing between the public, the emergency services, police and other mobile video device users, e.g. drone pilots, giving cheaper and easier access to this important source of information. If web browsers supported video geotagging natively using this file format, it would also become accessible to most web users. Current low-end smartphones already provide suitable hardware to concurrently capture video and geolocation streams, which would make this technology easily accessible to the general public, and encourage the user and developer communities to grow rapidly.

    <section class='informative' id='proposedsolution'>
      <h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
      <p>
        This proposal constitutes a lightweight markup language to synchronise video with geolocation data for display on electronic maps, e.g. Google Maps. It offers presentational control of the map display, e.g. pan and zoom, and annotation to highlight map features to the viewer, e.g. markers and labels.
      </p>
      <p>
        WebVMT (Web Video Map Tracks) format is intended for marking up external map track resources, and its main use is for files synchronising video content with an annotated map presentation. Ideas have been borrowed from existing W3C formats, including WebVTT's HTML binding and its block and cue structures, and SVG's approach to drawing and animation, in order to display output on an electronic map.
      </p>
      <p>
        The format mimics WebVTT's structure and syntax for video synchronisation, with cue details listed in an accessible text-based file linked to the &lt;video&gt; DOM element by a child &lt;track&gt; element in an HTML document.

          <p>
            In this example, an HTML page has a CSS style sheet in a &lt;style&gt; element that styles map cues for the video, e.g. drawing lines in red.

        <p>
          Map annotations may be animated using an &lt;animate&gt; element, in a similar way to <a data-cite='SVG11'>SVG</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Map paths have additional properties to other annotations including a unique identifier, and a drawing animation which can be controlled separately for distance calculation purposes.
        </p>
        <section id='animatedpath'>
          <h2>Animated Path</h2>
          <p>
            A path typically indicates a mobile camera's route, which is defined by a &lt;moveto&gt; element followed by a sequence of &lt;lineto&gt; elements, and may include multiple discrete segments separated by &lt;moveto&gt; elements.
          </p>
          <p>
            A path should be assigned an identifier using the 'pathId' attribute to discriminate it from other paths. This allow multiple paths to be uniquely identified, for different paths to be styled in different ways, e.g. colour, and also enables speed and distance calculations to be performed for each path during playback.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this example, an animated path is traced from London to Brighton:

      <h2>Data Model</h2>
      <p class='ednote'>
        The data model of WebVMT consists of three key elements: the video viewport, cues, and the map viewport. The video viewport is the rendering area for video output. Cues are containers consisting of a set of metadata lines. The map viewport is the rendering area for metadata lines, i.e. graphical annotations overlaid on an online map.
      </p>
      <section class='informative' id='overview'>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The WebVMT file is a container file for chunks of data that are time-aligned with a video or audio resource. It can therefore be regarded as a serialisation format for time-aligned data.
        </p>
        <p>
          A WebVMT file starts with a header and then contains a series of data blocks. If a data block has a start time, it is called a WebVMT cue. A comment is another kind of data block.
        </p>
        <p>
          A WebVMT file carries cues which are identified as <a data-cite='HTML51/semantics-embedded-content.html#attr-valuedef-track-kind-metadata'>metadata</a> and specified in the <a data-cite='HTML51/semantics-embedded-content.html#element-attrdef-track-kind'>kind</a> attribute of the <a data-cite='HTML51/semantics-embedded-content.html#the-track-element'>track</a> element in the <a data-cite='HTML51'>HTML</a> specification.
        </p>
        <p>
          The data kind of a WebVMT file is externally specified, such as in a HTML file’s <a data-cite='HTML51/semantics-embedded-content.html#the-track-element'>track</a> element. The environment is responsible for interpreting the data correctly.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <a>WebVMT cue</a> is rendered as an overlay on top of a metadata viewport.

              either <i>cue1</i> lies fully within <i>cue2</i>, i.e. <i>x1 >= x2</i> and <i>y1 <= y2</i>;
            </li>
            <li>
              or <i>cue1</i> fully contains <i>cue2</i>, i.e. <i>x1 <= x2</i> and <i>y1 >= y2</i>.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          The following example matches this definition:
        </p>
        <pre class='nohighlight example' title='Nested Cues'>
            #### TO DO ####
        </pre>
        <p>
          Notice how you can express the cues in this WebVMT file as a tree structure:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            #### TO DO ####
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If the file has cues that can’t be expressed in this fashion, then they don’t match the definition of a <a>WebVMT file using only nested cues</a>. For example:
        </p>
        <pre class='nohighlight example' title='Non-Nested Cues'>
            #### TO DO ####
        </pre>
        <p>
          In this ninety-second example, the two cues partly overlap, with the first ending before the second ends and the second starting before the first ends. This therefore is not a <a>WebVMT file using only nested cues</a>.

      <h2>Known Issues</h2>
      <p>
        This section captures issues which have been identified, but are not fully documented in this explanatory specification.
      </p>
      <p class='ednote'>
        As the specification develops, issues will be moved out of this section and included elsewhere in the document, until it is no longer needed and is completely removed.
      </p>
      <section id='plannedfeatures'>
        <h2>Planned Features</h2>
        <p>
          This section lists potential features which have been identified during the development process, but have not yet matured to a full design specification.
        </p>
        <p class='note'>
          Features which appear in this section warrant further investigation, but are not guaranteed to appear in the final specification.
        </p>
        <section id='marker'>
          <h2>Markers</h2>
          <p>
            An image linked to and displayed at an offset from a geolocation.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section id='label'>
          <h2>Labels</h2>
          <p>
            A text string linked to and displayed at an offset from a geolocation.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section id='tileshortcut'>
          <h2>Tile Shortcuts</h2>
          <p>
            Shortcuts to popular tile URLs for easy access and to help avoid URL syntax errors.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section id='layer'>
          <h2>Layers</h2>
          <p>
            Syntax to allow more than one layer of map tiles to be specified, e.g. Google Maps includes 'map' and 'satellite' layers.
          </p>
          <p>
            This should be functional, but remain lightweight.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section id='multipleapis'>
          <h2>Multiple APIs</h2>
          <p>
            The current tech demo is based on the Leaflet API, but should be broadened to support other web map APIs, e.g. Open Layers and Google Maps.
          </p>
          <p>
            A hot-swap feature would allow users to switch API on-the-fly to take advantage of the unique features supported by different APIs, e.g. Google Streetview.
          </p>

        <section id='cameradirection'>
          <h2>Camera Direction</h2>
          <p>
            Camera orientation may not match the direction of travel, or may be dynamic, e.g. for Augmented Reality.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section id='datasync'>
          <h2>Data Sync</h2>
          <p>
            Mobile video devices often collect additional data, e.g. drones can be used as sensor platforms and dashcams record vehicle telemetry such as speed and acceleration.
          </p>
          <p>
            Allowing the option to embed XML data within cues would permit synchronisation of arbitrary data with location and video without compromising interoperability, in a similar fashion to the GPX &lt;extension&gt; element.
